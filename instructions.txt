Backend + Flutter Hybrid Developer Assessment — Full Content

What You're Building
A task management application that automatically classifies and organizes tasks based on content analysis.
Example: User creates: "Schedule urgent meeting with team today about budget allocation"
System automatically:

Detects category: Scheduling (keywords: meeting, schedule)

Assigns priority: High (keywords: urgent, today)

Extracts entities: team, budget

Suggests actions: Block calendar, Send invite, Prepare agenda

Deliverables
Item	Required
Backend API (Node.js/FastAPI)	5 core endpoints
Database Schema	PostgreSQL/Supabase with 2 tables
Flutter Mobile App	Single dashboard screen
Live Deployment	Backend on Render.com
Documentation	GitHub README with setup instructions
Testing	Minimum 3 unit tests
Who Should Apply

Hands-on with Flutter (Dart) at production level

Strong Node.js (preferred) or Python/FastAPI backend skills

Experience with Supabase/PostgreSQL or similar

Role Expectations
Area	Ownership
Backend (60%)	API design, database architecture, classification workflows, integrations
Flutter (40%)	Production-ready features, performance optimization, clean architecture
What You'll Work On — Assessment Task

Build a "Smart Site Task Manager"

Must:

Allow creating, viewing, and managing tasks

Automatically classify & prioritize tasks using intelligent logic

Persist data in Supabase/PostgreSQL

Provide a polished Flutter mobile experience

Bonus if familiar with: LangGraph, LangChain, Render, Cloudflare

Part 1 — Backend (Node.js / FastAPI + Supabase)
Database Schema
tasks
id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
title text NOT NULL,
description text,
category text,    -- scheduling, finance, technical, safety, general
priority text,    -- high, medium, low
status text,      -- pending, in_progress, completed
assigned_to text,
due_date timestamp,
extracted_entities jsonb,
suggested_actions jsonb,
created_at timestamp,
updated_at timestamp

task_history
id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
task_id uuid REFERENCES tasks(id),
action text,      -- created, updated, status_changed, completed
old_value jsonb,
new_value jsonb,
changed_by text,
changed_at timestamp

API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/tasks	Create a new task (with auto-classification)
GET	/api/tasks	List all tasks (filters: status, category, priority)
GET	/api/tasks/{id}	Get task details with history
PATCH	/api/tasks/{id}	Update task
DELETE	/api/tasks/{id}	Delete task
Auto-Classification Logic

Category keywords

scheduling → meeting, schedule, call, appointment, deadline

finance → payment, invoice, bill, budget, cost, expense

technical → bug, fix, error, install, repair, maintain

safety → safety, hazard, inspection, compliance, PPE

general → default

Priority keywords

high → urgent, asap, immediately, today, critical, emergency

medium → soon, this week, important

low → default

Entity Extraction

Dates/times mentioned

Person names (after "with", "by", "assign to")

Location references

Action verbs

Suggested Actions

{
  "scheduling": ["Block calendar", "Send invite", "Prepare agenda", "Set reminder"],
  "finance": ["Check budget", "Get approval", "Generate invoice", "Update records"],
  "technical": ["Diagnose issue", "Check resources", "Assign technician", "Document fix"],
  "safety": ["Conduct inspection", "File report", "Notify supervisor", "Update checklist"]
}
